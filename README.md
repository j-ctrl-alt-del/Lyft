This project's purpose was to explore the Lyft Level 5 Autonomous Vehicle dataset in preparation for the SAS Global Forum 2020 Student Competition.  Data exploration indicated that the camera calibration data, specifically the focal length and optical center of each image, and the category data, identifying if an object was a car, truck, person, etc., offered the best chance for meaningful results.  Some interesting conclusions outlined in the project's paper include significant variances in the camera calibration data as well as strict segregation between which attributes, or actions, are associated with different object categories.
